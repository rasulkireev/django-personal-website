    <p>I started this website as a place to document everything I learn while on my path to become a highly qualified Data Scientist and a financially self-sufficient person. I am trying to make a habit of writing about everything I learn.</p>
    <p>My current goal is to find an entry level job in the Data Science field. I also want to make a useful product/app that would be useful to people but would also create an additional independent income stream, to support my family, financially.</p>
    <p>When I am not applying to jobs, connecting with people, or creating things, I enjoy spending time with my wife, Tania. We like to walk, travel, discover new places among other many things.</p>
    <p>We also enjoy photography and are looking for subjects to improve our photography skills. If you would be interested in this please contact us. Here is our portfolio.</p>
