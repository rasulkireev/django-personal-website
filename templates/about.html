        <h1 class="text-4xl">About</h1>
        <hr class="mb-2">
        <p class="mb-3 text-xl leading-relaxed">I started this website as a place to document everything I learn while on my path to become a Data Scientist and an Indie maker and generally a good person. I am trying to make a habit of writing about everything I learn.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 text-xl leading-relaxed">My current goal is to find an entry level job in the Data Science field. I also want to make a useful product/app that would be useful to people but would also create an additional independent income stream, to support my family, financially.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 text-xl leading-relaxed">When I am not applying to jobs, connecting with people, or creating things, I enjoy spending time with my wife, Tania. We like to walk, travel, discover new places among other many things.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 text-xl leading-relaxed">We also enjoy photography and are looking for subjects to improve our photography skills. If you would be interested in this please contact us. Here is our portfolio.</p>

          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            Just because I have not creativity and imagination I stole this design from <a href="https://joshpigford.com/">Josh Pigford</a> founder of <a href="https://baremetrics.com/">Baremetrics</a>.
            Josh, thanks for the inspiration. Promise to update the website to look more like me soon!
