# django-personal-website
This is my attempt to learn the essentials of Django through creating a personal website.


## TODO
This is the list of my ideas that I plan to add to my personal website:

- Place I would like to visit. 
  - This would be a page featuring a map (LocationIQ) with markers for the places I want to visit.
  - Additionally, below the map will be a list of the places, that can be sorted by country.
  - When a country is selected, the map and the list adjust automatically.
- The app that allows me too enter my investments and will display a graph based on the data.
  - Make it secure, such that if you want to display the graph it only shows the percentages , not the actual values of the portfolio.
- List of books I read, am reading or paln to read, as well as the notes on the ones I have read.
- A gallery of the photos I have taken, when learning to use a DSLR on manual
  - I want the "gallery to be by event/date
  - Additionally, the app must have functionality that I can upload multiple photos ate the time.
  - Ideally (I don't see how I can do it as of now), I would be able to convert images to jpeg from raw, as well as just compress the file size automatically.
