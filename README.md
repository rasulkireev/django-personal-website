# django-personal-website
This is my attempt to learn the essentials of Django through creating a personal website.


## TODO
This is the list of my ideas that I plan to add to my personal website:

- Place I would like to visit. 
  - This would be a page featuring a map (LocationIQ) with markers for the places I want to visit.
  - Additionally, below the map will be a list of the places, that can be sorted by country.
  - When a country is selected, the map and the list adjust automatically.
- The app that allows me too enter my investments and will display a graph based on the data.
  - Make it secure, such that if you want to display the graph it only shows the percentages , not the actual values of the portfolio.
